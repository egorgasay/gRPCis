# Objects

Instead of the usual tables, a model close to object orientation is used here. Let's see all the concepts:
- An object is a kind of instance of a class. Each "Object" has attributes and can have nested "Objects". 
- When creating an "Object", the server with the lowest load will be selected, but nested objects can only be created on its parent object server, this allows you to be sure that all data in one object is always available.
