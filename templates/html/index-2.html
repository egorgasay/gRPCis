        Hello, friend!<br>
        This is a web view for a single set\get to\from the distributed database called itisadb.<br>
        <br>
        How it works:<br>
        <br>
        1. Your request will be processed by a web service that will determine the appropriate gRPC method of the memory balancer.<br>
        <br>
        2. After that, the memory balancer will process your operation by saving\getting the necessary values from\to the storage(-s) and
        return you the value (or the error was not found) if it was a get operation or the server number (or the option number that
        you specified) on which the value was saved if it was a set operation.<br>
        <br>
        3. You will be able to see the value if it was a get operation or the server number if it was a set operation.<br>
        <br>
        Try it now! Type "help" for more information. <br>
